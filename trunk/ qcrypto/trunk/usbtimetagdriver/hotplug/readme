Ok, differnt versions of the new hotplugger for different OS versions:

for SuSE 9.3:
t5.hotplug goes into /ec/hotplug.d/usb/

This version is slightly flaky as there are only links to two timestamp cards
available at any time. The original set of permissions/ownership for the
directly created device are strange, the device seems to be owned by the group
disk. Inserted a device node with the correct permissions (is that safe???)


for SuSE 10.0:

60-timestamp.rules goes into /etc/udev/rules.d

changed to tstusb2.hotplug

todo: check compatibility with other OS versions
