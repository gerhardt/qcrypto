= Introduction =

This is the repository for the source code used in quantum key distribution, from key generation in from time-stamped data to error correction and privacy amplification.

The code was designed to work with entanglement-based pair detection schemes, either implementing a BB84-type protocol, or an Ekert-91 protocol, which we (Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore) used for our implementations.

The code is mostly ANSI C, typically compiled with current (2007) gcc versions.

Discussions on implementation details/problems/leaks are highly welcome, and should ultimately lead to an openly available implementation of a QKD scheme which hopefully has less open security problems than implementations using proprietary code.

In an initial phase, we will deposit code which has been running on specific linux systems in our labs, and definitions of file formats and hardware.

(to come: link to experiments, references, hardware description, circuits)

I need still to generate a nice svn directory for the different parts of the code. Currently,  everything is contained in one big tarball, and located off site [http://137.132.69.206/cryptoplay http://137.132.69.206/cryptoplay].
